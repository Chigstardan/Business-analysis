Here, I analyse the Correlation Matrix showing positive relationship between Profit & Sales, Quantity & Sales.
I also saw from the data the Company offering more Discount on Office Suppliers & furniture Category.
In the Central Region company(Store) giving lots of discount but the Output is very less in quantity.
Company Provides highest Quantity for Office Suppliers but Sales are not that much good enough, Quantity should be minimized and provide it to the Furniture category instead of Office Suppliers.
